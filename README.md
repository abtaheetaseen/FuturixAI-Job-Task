# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


1. This is basically a page that I created using React.
2. I use fake information for all of my content.
3. Every piece of data is kept in a public folder within a data.json file.
4. In App.jsx file, I fetch data and show it on UI.
5. I use react-modal npm package for modal.
6. When click on every image, modal opens and you can see the image, user name and description.
7. There is a close button. The button will close the modal when clicked.
